        I work with businesses in motion. You’re moving fast, solving problems, keeping customers happy, and the systems around you should keep pace.
      </div>

      <p>
        I work with people running real shops. The pace is constant, and my role is to bring steady support that matches how your business actually moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent years inside a fast moving retail and e-commerce company that lived in Shopify, ran a physical shop, traveled to events, and needed clean numbers at the end of each day. I worked across products, point of sale, payouts, fees, and inventory — building structure while everything was still in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I partner with a small number of owners who want someone reliable in the background. I get in sync, carry real weight, and help the work feel more manageable for both the business and the humans behind it.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up and clean up Shopify products, collections, and point of sale so your staff can use it without fighting it.</li>
        <li>Shape inventory habits that match how you sell, including events, pop ups, and busy seasons.</li>
        <li>Make Shopify and QuickBooks agree, including payouts, fees, refunds, discounts, gift cards, and sales tax.</li>
        <li>Stay on as ongoing support if you want a second brain instead of a one time project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        I come in calmly and pay attention. We look at how you sell, where the friction is, and what is draining time or energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there we fix the foundation first. That might mean restructuring products, changing how payouts hit the books, or simplifying how you track stock. I write things down in plain language so you and your team can keep it going.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The goal isn't a perfect system on paper. The goal is something you can live with on a busy day.
      </p>

      <h2>Start a conversation</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        If this sounds like what you need, send a short email with three things: how you sell today, what tools you use, and what feels messy or heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll let you know if it sounds like a match and what a first step might look like, including a rough range for cost and timing.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        No pressure. Just clarity.
