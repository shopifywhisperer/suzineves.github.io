    <h1>Suzi Neves</h1>

    <h2>For small businesses in motion: grounded support that keeps up—with all of it.</h2>

    <p>
      I work with people growing real businesses, meeting the relentless pace with instinct, clarity,
      and a shared drive to make it work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent years inside a fast-moving retail and e-commerce company, spanning Shopify,
      in-person sales systems, product workflows, inventory, and the kind of operational decisions
      that can’t wait for perfect conditions. They just have to work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring steady follow-through and clear thinking to every business I work with.
      I get in sync fast, carry real weight, and help make things feel more possible—for the business
      and for the humans behind it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that kind of collaboration sounds like a fit, I’d love to talk.
    </p>
